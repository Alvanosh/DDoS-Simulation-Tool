## **⚡️ Overview**

Welcome to the **Advanced DDoS Simulation Tool**, a next-level educational tool for demonstrating and simulating DDoS attacks. This tool is designed for ethical use only, allowing you to understand and test network defenses in a controlled environment.

### 🌟 **Key Features:**
- **TCP, UDP, and HTTP/HTTPS Flood Attacks**: Simulate multiple types of DDoS attacks with precision.
- **Multi-Threaded**: Launch parallel threads to scale the intensity of the simulation.
- **Custom Payload Injection**: Customize your payload for every attack, allowing for more detailed control.
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Track successful and failed attack attempts with real-time updates in the GUI.
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting (max requests per second) to ensure responsible testing.
- **Domain Resolution**: Automatically resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- **HTTPS Support**: Added support for HTTPS-based flood attacks.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Detailed error messages and logging provide insights during testing.

### 🛠️ **Features in Detail:**
- **🌐 Protocol-Specific Flood Attacks**  
  Choose between TCP, UDP, HTTP, or HTTPS attacks. Whether simulating attacks on ports or services, this tool provides a complete approach to testing.
  
- **⚡ Multi-Threaded Execution**  
  Boost your simulation by specifying multiple threads. Simultaneously run multiple attack threads to maximize load and stress on target services.

- **📈 Real-Time Feedback**  
  Receive updates on the number of successful and failed attack requests directly in the graphical interface (GUI). Watch your statistics change in real-time as the attack progresses.

- **🛡️ Rate Limiting for Controlled Testing**  
  Built-in rate limiting to ensure a controlled testing environment, perfect for educational use cases and simulations.

- **🔒 HTTPS Ready**  
  Flood HTTPS targets with confidence, thanks to the tool's SSL/TLS support.

- **📡 Custom Payload and Interval Control**  
  Adjust the payload content and attack interval (time between requests) to fine-tune your simulations.

## **🚀 How to Use the Tool**

### **Pre-requisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Required Python libraries (Install via `pip`):
   ```bash
   pip install requests ratelimit
   ```

### **Steps to Run the Tool:**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alvanosh/DDoS-Simulation-Tool.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DDoS-Simulation-Tool
   ```

3. **Run the Tool**:
   ```bash
   python ddos_simulation_tool.py
   ```

4. **User-Friendly GUI**:  
   The tool provides a highly interactive **Graphical User Interface** (GUI) built using Tkinter. Here’s what you need to enter:  
   - **Target (IP or Domain)**: Specify the target’s IP address or domain name.  
   - **Port**: Choose the port to attack.  
   - **Attack Type**: Select the attack type (TCP, UDP, or HTTP).  
   - **Payload**: Input the custom payload for the attack.  
   - **Interval (seconds)**: Set the interval between requests to control the pace.  
   - **Number of Threads**: Define how many threads to run simultaneously for scaling the attack.  
   - **HTTPS Option**: Check the box for HTTPS attacks.
