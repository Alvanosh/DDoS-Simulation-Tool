## 🌟 Overview
Dive into the world of cybersecurity with the **DDoS Simulation Tool**! This powerful Python application allows you to simulate various types of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using an intuitive Tkinter GUI. Designed for **educational purposes**, this tool aims to provide insights into the mechanics of DDoS attacks.

## 🎨 Features
- 🌐 **Multiple Attack Modes**: Select from TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS to execute your simulations.
- 🔄 **Customizable Parameters**: Input target, port, payload, interval, and number of threads for personalized attacks.
- 🔍 **Robust Input Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled out correctly to prevent errors.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous Performance**: Leverages `asyncio` for efficient network handling, allowing for high performance.
- 🌙 **Sleek Dark Theme**: Enjoy a modern and user-friendly interface designed for ease of use.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following packages. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install tkinter requests aiohttp
```

### ⚙️ How to Use the Tool
1. **Enter Target**: Input the target IP address or domain name.
2. **Specify Port**: Enter a port number (1-65535).
3. **Choose Attack Type**: Select between TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS.
4. **Define Payload**: Specify the data you want to send during the attack.
5. **Set Interval**: Enter the interval (in seconds) for sending the payload.
6. **Determine Number of Threads**: Decide how many simultaneous threads you want to run.
7. **Start the Attack**: Click the **Start Attack 🚀** button to initiate the simulation.
8. **Stop the Attack**: Click the **Stop Attack 🛑** button to halt all operations.

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Responsible Use**: This tool is for educational purposes only. **Never** use it against unauthorized targets.
- **Learning Resource**: Use this tool to understand the impact of DDoS attacks and improve your cybersecurity skills.

## 💻 Code Breakdown
The core functionalities of the tool include:
- **GUI Setup**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive user interface.
- **Thread Management**: Handles multiple threads to simulate simultaneous requests.
- **Input Validation**: Validates user inputs to ensure proper execution.
- **Asynchronous Flood Functions**: Implements TCP and asynchronous HTTP/HTTPS flood methods.

### 🔍 Example Code Snippet
Here’s a glimpse of the main function to start an attack:

```python
def start_attack():
    try:
        target = target_entry.get().strip()  # Retrieve target IP/domain
        port = port_entry.get().strip()  # Retrieve port number
        # Additional code logic...
        messagebox.showinfo("Success", "Attack started successfully! 🚀")
    except ValueError as ve:
        messagebox.showerror("Input Error", str(ve))  # Show input error
```

4. **User-Friendly GUI**:  
   The tool provides a highly interactive **Graphical User Interface** (GUI) built using Tkinter. Here’s what you need to enter:  
   - **Target (IP or Domain)**: Specify the target’s IP address or domain name.  
   - **Port**: Choose the port to attack.  
   - **Attack Type**: Select the attack type (TCP, UDP, or HTTP).  
   - **Payload**: Input the custom payload for the attack.  
   - **Interval (seconds)**: Set the interval between requests to control the pace.  
   - **Number of Threads**: Define how many threads to run simultaneously for scaling the attack.  
   - **HTTPS Option**: Check the box for HTTPS attacks.
